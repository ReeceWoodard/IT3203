            <h3>The Beginning of HTML</h3>
            <p>The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist at CERN. Berners-Leeâ€™s vision was to create a universal information system accessible to anyone with a computer and an internet connection.</p>
            <p>The introduction of HTML in 1993 marked a significant milestone, as it was the first standardized method for structuring documents on the internet. HTML 1.0 allowed users to create simple, text-based web pages linked via hypertext, laying the groundwork for the internet we know today. It supported basic elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and hyperlinks, but lacked advanced features like tables, images, or scripting. Despite its limitations, HTML 1.0 caused a fast growth of websites and was crucial in popularizing the World Wide Web. Its simplicity made it easy to learn, encouraging a wide range of users to begin building their own websites.</p>

            <h3>HTML 2.0</h3>
            <p>In 1994, an international organization called the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was established to control web standards, which eventually led to the release of HTML 2.0 in 1995. This new version standardized several key features, such as forms, tables, and the ability to include multimedia elements. </p>
            <p>HTML 2.0 made the internet more interactive, which led to more dynamic content and a better user experience. For example, the addition of forms made online data submission much easier and eventually led to modern e-commerce and social media sites.</p>
