            <h3>HTML5</h3>
            <p>When HTML5 was released in 2014, it marked a turning point in web development, as both users and developers began demanding increasingly more complex tools for more modern applications. One of its most notable features was the introduction of native support for multimedia elements like video and audio, which eliminated the need for third-party plugins such as Adobe Flash. This not only improved performance and security but also made high-quality media content more accessible across different devices and platforms.</p>
            <p>HTML5 also introduced new useful APIs and new semantic elements like article, section, and nav, which helped developers create more organized and intuitive page structures. The canvas element, as well as technology like WebGL and SVG, allowed for the rendering of complex, interactive graphics and even video games that could be played directly in the browser without any external software. HTML5 also included features such as local storage and offline caching, which made it possible to run web applications without an internet connection. It supported geolocation, drag-and-drop, and real-time communication with the WebSocket API. Today, HTML5 continues to evolve and remains at the core of nearly all modern websites.</p>
