        <h3>HTML5</h3>
        <p>When HTML5 was released in 2014, it marked a turning point in web development, as users began demanding increasingly more complex tools. HTML5 introduced native support for multimedia elements like video and audio, which eliminated the need for third-party plugins like Adobe Flash.</p>
        <p>Other features like the canvas element and WebGL allowed for the creation of interactive graphics and gaming from within a browser. These innovations made HTML5 an even more fundamental part of modern web applications, such as streaming services and social media.</p>
