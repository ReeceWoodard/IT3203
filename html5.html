            <h3>HTML5</h3>
            <p>The release of HTML5 in 2014, following years of collaboration between the W3C and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), marked a turning point in web development. Both users and developers began demanding increasingly more complex tools for more modern applications, eventually leading to HTML5, the most current version of HTML. One of its most notable features was the introduction of native support for multimedia elements like video and audio, which eliminated the need for third-party plugins such as Adobe Flash. This not only improved performance and security but also made high-quality media content more accessible across different devices and platforms.</p>
            <p>HTML5 also introduced new useful APIs and new semantic elements like article, section, and nav, which helped developers create more organized and intuitive page structures. The canvas element, as well as technology like WebGL and SVG, allowed for the rendering of complex, interactive graphics and even video games that could be played directly in the browser without any external software. HTML5 also included features such as local storage and offline caching, which made it possible to run web applications without an internet connection. HTML5 introduced or supported numerous APIs, including geolocation, drag-and-drop, and real-time communication with the WebSocket API. HTML5 was designed with mobile-first development in mind, ensuring easy compatability with smartphones and tablets. It focused on performance optimization, responsiveness, and cross-platform operability, which has helped make web apps competitive with native mobile applications. Today, HTML5 remains as the cornerstone of the modern web. It is continuously updated as part of a "living standard", meaning it evolves organically as the web needs change. Its flexibility, power, and broad popularity have ensured that HTML will remain at the heart of web development, even in the future.</p>
